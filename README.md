# stanford-cs224n
This is a part of coding assignments related to CS-224n course headed by Cristopher Manning. 

CAUTION:
I am not enrolled to this course and these assignments are not graded by anyone. I am learning on my own and completing these assignments. Coding assignments have passed basic autograd tests if available.

I would be grateful if anyone can go through this and point out mistakes if possible.
